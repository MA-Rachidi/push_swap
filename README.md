# Push_swap

## ðŸ“– Description
Push_swap is an algorithmic project that focuses on sorting integers on stacks using a minimal set of operations.
It is an excellent introduction to algorithm complexity, optimization, and problem-solving under constraints.
Beyond designing efficient sorting strategies, the project also emphasizes strict memory management in C â€” ensuring zero leaks, correct allocation, and robustness against invalid input.

## ðŸš€ Usage


# Compile
```
make        # build push_swap
make bonus  # build checker (bonus)
```

# Run push_swap
```
./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
```

# Run with checker (bonus)
```
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"
./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```
